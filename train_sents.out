BELGRADE	,	Yugoslavia	(	AP	)	_	With	Vojislav	Kostunica	in	office	as	president	,	backers	of	the	pro-democracy	leader	embarked	Sunday	on	the	potentially	volatile	task	of	forming	a	government	that	tries	to	exclude	backers	of	former	leader	Slobodan	Milosevic	.

UNITED	NATIONS	(	AP	)	_	The	General	Assembly	is	expected	to	hold	an	emergency	meeting	next	week	on	the	Middle	East	to	consider	a	resolution	that	would	condemn	``	excessive	use	of	force	''	by	Israeli	soldiers	,	according	to	a	draft	obtained	by	The	Associated	Press	.

The	draft	is	stronger	than	the	resolution	adopted	by	the	Security	Council	last	Saturday	,	but	the	wording	was	softer	on	Israel	compared	to	past	resolutions	on	the	Israel	-	Palestinian	conflict	.

The	draft	supports	continued	negotiations	in	search	of	peace	and	takes	no	side	on	divisive	issues	such	as	Jerusalem	,	saying	only	that	the	holy	places	there	must	be	respected	.

MOSCOW	(	AP	)	_	Russian	lawmakers	on	Friday	overwhelmingly	approved	the	Soviet	anthem	as	Russia	's	national	hymn	_	a	move	praised	by	some	as	a	gesture	of	reconciliation	and	denounced	by	others	as	a	symbolic	approval	of	the	nation	's	totalitarian	past	.

The	move	restored	the	old	anthem	's	music	by	composer	Alexander	Alexandrov	but	not	the	original	text	that	included	praise	for	Communist	leaders	Vladimir	Lenin	and	Josef	Stalin	.

NICE	,	France	(	AP	)	_	One	after	another	,	late	into	the	night	,	the	leaders	of	Europe	filed	into	a	small	,	windowless	room	for	private	chats	with	French	President	Jacques	Chirac	that	could	determine	the	future	of	the	European	Union	.

Chirac	was	fighting	to	break	a	deadlock	over	how	to	modify	the	15-	nation	EU	's	decision-making	mechanisms	to	cope	with	its	planned	expansion	into	the	former	communist	East	.

On	Saturday	morning	,	after	he	'd	finished	seeing	the	other	14	EU	leaders	,	Chirac	was	scheduled	to	send	them	a	draft	Treaty	of	Nice	_	a	blueprint	for	running	the	bloc	of	370	million	people	as	it	prepares	for	a	dozen	new	members	.

His	efforts	,	which	took	place	in	the	midst	of	a	crucial	three-day	EU	summit	in	this	French	resort	city	,	were	a	step	toward	the	agreement	that	everyone	gathered	here	says	is	necessary	_	but	nobody	thinks	will	be	easy	.

The	new	Supreme	Court	term	,	which	opens	today	,	has	no	high-profile	cases	to	match	last	session	's	tangles	over	partial	birth	abortion	,	gays	in	the	Boy	Scouts	and	organized	prayer	at	high	school	football	games	.

The	court	's	docket	includes	cases	that	,	depending	on	their	outcome	,	could	significantly	bolster	or	weaken	environmental	protection	,	federal	civil	rights	,	freedom	of	the	press	and	the	Fourth	Amendment	's	shield	against	unreasonable	searches	and	seizures	.

In	another	big	federalism	case	with	implications	for	the	environment	,	the	court	will	consider	whether	Congress	exceeded	its	Commerce	Clause	powers	by	allowing	regulation	of	small	,	intrastate	wetlands	to	protect	the	habitats	of	migratory	birds	.

Swarms	of	jellyfish	consumed	so	many	fish	eggs	and	larvae	in	the	Gulf	of	Mexico	this	summer	that	some	scientists	are	talking	about	the	potential	for	serious	future	threats	to	commercial	and	recreational	fisheries	in	the	northern	Gulf	.

The	jellyfish	,	a	native	species	and	an	invading	one	,	appeared	in	prime	spawning	areas	just	as	breeding	season	for	many	of	the	Gulf	's	most	important	species	kicked	into	high	gear	.

According	to	the	National	Marine	Fisheries	Service	,	the	number	of	jellyfish	in	the	Gulf	has	been	rising	for	at	least	13	years	.

Scientists	say	the	jellyfish	are	exploiting	three	major	human	-induced	changes	in	the	environment	:	thousands	of	oil	rigs	and	artificial	reefs	established	to	attract	game	fish	have	greatly	increased	the	breeding	habitat	for	jellyfish	,	which	need	a	hard	surface	for	spawning	;	nitrogen	pollution	from	farm	runoff	and	industrial	sources	feeds	plankton	blooms	,	providing	extra	food	for	jellyfish	;	and	commercial	fishermen	take	great	numbers	of	menhaden	,	a	soft-finned	,	bony	fish	that	competes	with	jellyfish	for	the	plankton	.

Dr.	Monty	Graham	,	a	researcher	at	the	Dauphin	Island	Sea	Lab	in	Alabama	,	worries	that	with	all	these	advantages	jellyfish	cannot	help	but	multiply	at	an	astonishing	rate	.

In	a	somewhat	rambling	apology	to	Lennon	's	widow	,	Yoko	Ono	,	Chapman	,	45	,	said	first	that	he	could	not	imagine	her	pain	,	and	later	that	he	had	felt	it	for	the	first	time	after	reading	a	recent	Newsweek	article	in	which	she	said	she	had	been	shaking	uncontrollably	the	night	of	her	husband	's	death	.

Chapman	,	who	has	been	criticized	for	seeming	to	revel	in	televised	appearances	after	his	conviction	,	was	consistently	self-deprecating	throughout	the	50-minute	hearing	.

Chapman	's	pursuit	of	publicity	occupied	much	of	the	discussion	,	despite	his	professed	wish	to	return	to	the	anonymity	that	had	plagued	him	,	as	a	security	guard	in	Hawaii	,	enough	to	make	him	commit	his	notorious	crime	.

Donald	Phillips	,	chief	executive	of	Morningstar	Inc	.,	which	tracks	mutual	funds	,	said	that	Arthur	Levitt	,	the	chairman	of	the	SEC	,	had	a	double	standard	toward	stockholders	and	mutual	fund	shareholders	.

A	federal	judge	in	Delaware	,	in	a	decision	made	public	on	Tuesday	,	held	that	one	company	's	corporate	tax	shelter	was	a	sham	and	noted	that	85	other	large	corporations	used	the	same	deduction	to	avoid	paying	$6	billion	in	corporate	income	taxes	.

U.S.	District	Court	Judge	Murray	Schwartz	in	Wilmington	,	Del.	,	ruled	that	Camelot	Music	could	not	deduct	interest	on	loans	it	took	out	against	life	insurance	on	its	1,430	employees	in	1990	through	1993	.

The	decision	could	affect	many	of	the	other	85	companies	,	which	the	judge	did	not	identify	by	name	,	because	his	ruling	applies	to	every	company	organized	in	Delaware	,	whose	corporate-governance	laws	have	made	it	a	major	center	for	large	companies	to	have	their	nominal	headquarters	.

Schwartz	said	that	there	was	no	build	up	in	the	cash	value	of	the	insurance	policies	and	because	of	the	way	the	loans	were	structured	there	was	no	reasonable	prospect	that	the	company	would	profit	from	buying	the	insurance	.

Wall	Street	and	other	global	markets	were	concerned	that	the	violence	would	translate	into	higher	oil	prices	_	which	it	did	,	briefly	_	and	that	those	prices	,	in	turn	,	could	lead	to	inflation	and	higher	interest	rates	.

``	It	would	not	surprise	me	if	the	pope	were	to	retire	after	2000	,''	says	Cardinal	Godfried	Danneels	in	a	book	to	be	published	on	Monday	in	Belgium	.
